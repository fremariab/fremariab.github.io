                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                  I’ve always been fascinated by how technology connects
                  everything around us. For me, IoT is where data, web
                  technologies, and AI come together to shape the future — from
                  smart cities to safer transportation. I’m especially
                  interested in transportation safety, where real-time data and
                  automation can save lives.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Beyond tech, I care deeply about representation in STEM. With
                  women still underrepresented in many fields, I’m passionate
                  about mentoring, engaging in initiatives, and one day building
                  my own program to support and inspire young women in tech.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  At my core, I’m curious, innovative, and impact-driven. For
                  me, technology isn’t just lines of code — it’s a tool to solve
                  real problems and improve lives.
                </p>

        <h2>The Importance of the Systems Development Life Cycle</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Sir Arthur Conan Doyle once said,
          <em
            >“It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are
            infinitely the most important”.</em
          >
          Indeed the little things in life have the most significance (like my
          5’5″ self!). This highlights how people focus on the product but not
          the process. For example, if a new exeat system would’ve been
          developed in SOS-HGIC, most people would pay particular attention to
          how the system has improved, rather than how the system came to be.
          Relating this example to the quote, it is evident that in developing a
          new system, the most important characteristic of the system, unknown
          to many, is how it came to be, specifically through the Systems
          Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The importance of the Systems
          Development Life Cycle can be evaluated in many areas. In this blog
          post, I am going to elaborate on some of these areas and relate it to
          the Systems Development Life Cycle.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          End-users, individuals who the system was purposefully designed for,
          play key roles in the planning of new systems. When planning a new
          system, the project managers must think of the end-users in all the
          stages of the SDLC. It is essential as the system must meet all the
          requirements of the end-users and must work to the standards of the
          end-users. If this does not happen, all the money and resources spent
          on the new system will be futile and the project would be deemed as a
          project failure. This then connects to the SDLC, which makes it
          necessary for those developing the system to always have the end-user
          in mind. For example, in our proposed solution for the SOS-HGIC Exeat
          System, the usability and functionality as well as the speed of the
          approval process, were all taken into consideration with respect to
          the end-users. Initially, end-users had problems with the system about
          delays and losses. For instance, user documentation makes sure that
          the end-users have information on how the system works as well as some
          other background knowledge. End-users are thought of here since the
          system may be difficult to use. Another instance is user acceptance
          testing also known as beta testing. This is done to make sure that
          there is an ease of use when using the system in real conditions. The
          importance of the Systems Development Life Cycle is then prominent
          when evaluating the role of end-users when planning a new system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In addition, the relevant stakeholders play a part in the planning
          process. A stakeholder is an individual interested in and is affected
          by the activities of an organisation. The SDLC ensures that
          stakeholders are informed about the stage the project is in as they
          invest their funds into the project and are affected by changes. For
          example if the system doesn’t work in the long run they will be
          affected. With the use of the SDLC, this can be avoided where the
          justification of possible solutions takes place. A SWOT analysis is
          carried out to see if the new system is profitable by making sure that
          the benefits outweigh the costs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Utilitarianism, doing the greatest good for the greatest number brings
          out the importance of the Systems Development Life Cycle . When
          developing a new system, there are many processes involved like
          getting software for the system and following standardised procedures.
          For example in the SDLC, quality assurance methods like the Capability
          Maturity Model Integration ensures that the development team are
          following standardised practices at all times (Stuart Gray 320).It is
          essential that teams must follow copyright laws which will in turn
          benefit the end-users.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Nevertheless, as beneficial as the Systems Development Life Cycle is,
          it has its flaws as it has social and ethical issues connected to it.
          One issue that arises is the equality of access. The Systems
          Development Life Cycle suggests that users must employ some methods
          and use systems, like bug tracking systems and have different types of
          maintenance but the reality of the situation is that not all people or
          organizations have access to this.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All things considered, the Systems Development Life Cycle is important
          to a large extent as it avoids project failure and benefits the
          organisation in the long run.

        <h2>Multimedia Manipulation</h2>
        <p>
          Picture this. You’re casually scrolling through Instagram, liking some
          posts that you come across but you get a bit bored so you start going
          through people’s stories. You keep tapping through stories and it
          seems everyone’s story is similar – they all have that one post.
          You’re immediately interested and want to know more about the post and
          its significance. I’m positive that this has happened to you quite a
          number of times. As you can see from the pictured situation,
          undeniably, IT influences the way we think and determines what we
          regard as valuable or important to a large extent. In this blog post,
          I will be justifying this assertion in the context of
          multimedia/digital media.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In order to reveal the influence of IT on the way we think and as well
          as what we consider to be valuable or important, we must first have an
          idea of the IT system in question which is multimedia. Multimedia
          refers to the “the use and integration of media such as text, images
          and graphic elements, to create digital products that are available
          online or offline” (International Baccalaureate 2010). Multimedia
          usually involves audio editing, animations, video editing and photo
          editing. These branches of multimedia all require the manipulation of
          alignment, colour management and resolution, and involve cropping,
          layering, and filtering (Stuart 2011). Multimedia has many areas of
          impact such as education and home and leisure, in which the primary
          stakeholders differ respectively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In education, multimedia has to a large extent influenced the way we
          think as well as determine what we regard as valuable or important. In
          education multimedia is used to help simplify concepts and topics for
          particular subjects. For instance, in biology, multimedia is used to
          explain the process of photosynthesis in a much shorter time as
          compared to reading. In such a case, it is possible that in the video
          or picture perhaps, some particular text has been animated to have
          more emphasis which would be difficult to do in a book. The use of the
          animation has been used to place emphasis on a particular word
          indicating that that particular part of the process is important. This
          clearly shows how IT has influenced what we consider to be important.
          One social and ethical issue that is raised in this area of impact is
          people and machines and policies. Students, the primary stakeholders
          in this case, are now using multimedia to learn as it helps in
          explanations and in revision. Students now prefer to learn using
          multimedia as compared to physical textbooks. This suggests that they
          are now spending more time online which may turn out to have negative
          effects, as their interaction with IT can result in eyestrain and
          headaches. As a result, policies must come in to limit the screen time
          for students when using multimedia in such a light.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Moreover, looking at home and leisure, multimedia has to a large
          extent influenced the way we think as well as determine what we regard
          as valuable or important. In home and leisure, social media is a great
          example. Social media is one of the ways in which multimedia is shared
          frequently. For instance on twitter, many posts are used to share
          information. Recently, after the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Nigeria
          started mistreating civilians, a number of Nigerians used multimedia
          to share information regarding the attacks. Thousands of twitter users
          shared the posts to raise awareness and get international attention
          which proved to be fruitful. The use of social media in such an
          instance, shows that indeed there is strength in numbers. With
          thousands of people retweeting “#ENDSARS” posts, many news agencies
          and individuals, would have been influenced by the opposition to the
          SARS unit, and would have started thinking in the same way. Not only
          that but also would have started to see the #ENDSARS protest as
          something of value and something significant.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, this brings into question how the increasing global dominance
          of multimedia gives rise to an increasing uniformity of thinking.
          Using the example stated earlier, the #ENDSARS protests were used to
          raise awareness. More and more people, through the use of such
          multimedia, not only got to know about the situation in Nigeria, but
          also formed an opinion on the whole issue. This likened them to the
          many Nigerians who used social media to amplify their cry for help. In
          doing so, they gained more support from people who thought the same
          way and who had the same beliefs – that the SARS unit should be
          dissolved. With more people thinking alike and seeing the benefits of
          the use of multimedia, many people will start to repost such posts and
          not credit the original creator. This sheds light on one of the most
          important social and ethical issues in multimedia, namely,
          intellectual property. This refers to “ideas, discoveries, writings,
          works of art, software, collections and presentations of data”
          (International Baccalaureate 2010). In order to ensure that the
          reposter does not take credit for the original work of the creator,
          the post will be copyrighted or watermarked to ensure that all credit
          goes where it is due.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Taking all things into consideration, it is evident that IT influences
          the way we think and determines what we regard as valuable or
          important to a large extent. By exploring a number of areas of impact,
          it is clear that multimedia in this case, can influence the way people
          think as well as show what is deemed as important. This shows how
          important technological developments in such a field are. One who
          understands such a statement, can use it to their benefit. For
          instance, governments use multimedia to campaign. One example is John
          Mahama using a generic design, a stock photo, for his presidential
          campaign logo. The multimedia was used to campaign but the editing was
          so generic it caused an uproar amongst some. This resulted in a number
          of people sharing the post to many and ultimately, sharing John
          Mahama’s campaign poster. This all displays our dependence on IT to
          share ideas and information but to what extent can we keep our
          independence as we have now seen that IT can influence our way of
          thinking.

        <h2>Finding A Connection</h2>
        <p>
          How often do you find yourself Googling “synonym for ….”? Frequently?
          Well for me, I do that every single day when I do my homework. I’m
          sure we can all testify to how IT systems such as the internet have
          simplified many things in our everyday lives. From using the internet
          to write essays, to effectively communicating with others as well as
          selling products. With a wide range of uses, the issue of humans’ over
          reliance on the largest network in the world is brought to light.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The internet can be described as a “global wide area network that
          connects computer systems across the world.” This collection of
          networks allows other users to connect with people globally through
          the sharing of a variety of information. However, the use of this IT
          system influences the accessibility of information and the validity of
          such information.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For instance, the internet is used in a number of areas of impact such
          as education, home and leisure and health. In education, information
          from Mass Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be accessed by students
          globally, provided that they have a device with stable internet
          connection. For instance in 2019, with 13,500 courses, the modern MOOC
          movement reached 120 million learners (Shah). In home and leisure, the
          internet is most commonly used in social networking software
          applications that allow users to create profiles and share content
          with other users on the platform. One famous example, Tiktok, has
          garnered over 5 billion downloads as of December 2020 (Iqbal). For
          health, information about the symptoms of different illnesses and
          diseases can be accessed on the internet. For example, according to
          Google Trends, search interest in the COVID-19 vaccine has reached an
          all-time high globally as of 11th March 2021 (Google Trends).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For these reasons, many internet users strive to have the best devices
          that allow them to access information more efficiently and rapidly.
          The movement of 3G users to LTE users is a prime display of humans’
          over reliance on the internet. The number of LTE users increased from
          3.9 billion in 2018 to 5.8 billion in 2021 (Statista). This need for
          faster bandwidth reveals the extent to which users depend on the
          internet.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With an understanding of the uses of the internet and the growing need
          for faster and reliable access to information on the internet, it is
          worthy to note that the quality of information found on the internet
          plays a large role. Undoubtedly, there is some information on the
          internet that is guaranteed to be reliable. Most internet users are
          under the impression that information on the internet is more likely
          to be up-to-date as web pages can be easily edited when new
          information comes about. This up-to-date information is easily
          accessible especially with the use of search engines. The introduction
          of web 2.0 technologies has also influenced the quality of information
          on the internet as they allow users to share content on the internet.
          If any ordinary internet user visits web 2.0 technologies such as
          blogs or wikis like Wikipedia, they are most likely to consider it as
          reliable due to it being “peer reviewed” in a sense. These factors
          have made the information available on the internet to be valid and
          reliable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, it must be highlighted that the information on the internet
          is far from perfect. The information on the internet does not go
          through any checking process and hence there are vast amounts of
          information that are biased, incorrect and inaccurate. Moreover, if
          search engines are not used properly, there is the possibility that
          users may be overloaded with irrelevant information. There is also the
          issue of accessing information on undesirable websites. For instance,
          users may connect to websites that are not genuine which could pose a
          number of security risks. These unresolved issues of credibility and
          undesirability are often overlooked by internet users.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Thus, when looking at the effects of such control, it can be said that
          humans have over time developed an over reliance on the internet. With
          easy access to a variety of information from anywhere in the world,
          internet users will often overlook the negative aspects of information
          accessed on the internet in an attempt to quickly get the information
          we need. It is for these reasons that human beings do not necessarily
          “believe these things to be true” but rather accept this information
          without questioning the validity and reliability of the information.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Taking all things into consideration, IT such as the internet, to some
          extent influences the accessibility of information and the reasons for
          blindly accepting this information, not thinking of its reliability or
          validity. This results in an over reliance on technology as humans are
          not used to not putting in effort to carry out tasks. This loosely
          relates to the concept of nomophobia, where users can not live without
          technology. In that regard, all internet users must start to monitor
          the degree to which they depend on technology in order to avoid such
          effects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Still can’t see the impact of IT systems on the accessibility of
          information in our daily lives? My challenge to you today is to spend
          a whole day without using a search engine of any kind – it will reveal
          to you the intensity of our dependence on the internet. Maybe we
          should our quests for finding connections and look up from our devices
          make those connections ourselves.

        <h2>The Usefulness of Facial Recognition</h2>
        <p>
          We live in a world where everything is developing a technological
          alternative. I recently chanced upon some articles that commented on
          the use of Artificial Intelligence in different areas of impact. They
          commented on the Chinese response to the application of facial
          recognition in helping make governmental decisions and the other made
          mention of the development of Artificial Intelligence to help African
          institutions in their provision of services. I am mainly interested in
          the role facial recognition software plays in different areas of
          impact. As a result, in this blog post, I will be evaluating the
          extent to which the usefulness of facial recognition software is
          dependent on the area of impact being considered.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To understand its usefulness we must first get an understanding of
          what facial recognition software is. This IT system seeks to “use
          biometrics to map facial features from a photograph or video and it
          compares the information with a database of known faces to find a
          match.” This branch of artificial intelligence has the appearance of
          human-like intelligence and it’s success in identity verification has
          allowed it to be used in a number of scenarios.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For instance, facial recognition software has been developed by a
          young girl in Ghana, namely Charlette N’Guessan, to help African
          institutions and industries that rely on the software in the provision
          of services. Her development of the software named BACE API, did not
          only make her win the 2020 Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation,
          but also helped these institutions, like Ghanaian banks, confront the
          pressing issue of cybercrime and identity theft. BACE API’s area of
          impact is business and employment and I believe it will have a
          positive and beneficial impact on the institutions that use it.
          However, it is crucial to note that all that glitters is not gold.
          Although in this situation, the use of facial recognition software
          appears to be fruitful, in other situations facial recognition
          software is being used “to track dangerous criminals and legitimate
          political protesters.” In this situation after a series of protests
          against the expedition of criminals to mainland China, the Chinese
          government has leveraged the surveillance systems they had in place
          and coupled with the facial recognition software to arrest protesters.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Evidently, the usefulness of facial recognition software varies
          depending on the area of impact being considered. Nonetheless, to make
          the argument more justifiable, we must consider the social and ethical
          concerns that come along with the use of the software. I perceive the
          development of the software, BACE API to aid in digital citizenship as
          with such a system in place, more people would have a more ethical and
          legal approach concerning the use of IT. On the contrary, the use of
          facial recognition software in Hong Kong, brings forth a number of
          social and ethical concerns such as privacy, surveillance, policies
          and anonymity. Protesters are upset that their privacy is not being
          respected. They believe that they have the right to determine for
          themselves when, how and to what extent information about themselves
          is being shared with others. Be that as it may, I find it very
          surprising that they expect their voices to be heard when they have
          turned around to do the exact same thing by leaking private
          information to government authorities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This further encourages the act of surveillance as the government will
          want to not only monitor their actions again but use facial
          recognition to identify them and arrest them. The protesters believe
          that if the Hong Kong government says that there are privacy controls
          in place to govern the use of the software, then the government should
          ensure that the said controls are being implemented. The issue of
          policies arises because if there were enforceable measures created to
          monitor the inappropriate use relating to information technologies
          such as surveillance cameras, the use of facial recognition software
          and even using social media platforms, the situation would have been
          less catastrophic. It all boils down to authenticity; facial
          recognition software helps to establish a user’s identity beyond
          reasonable doubt. The only way this would be a concern is if
          individuals have done something bad and do not want to be held
          accountable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All things considered, I believe that to a large extent, the
          usefulness of facial recognition software is dependent on the area of
          impact being considered. It is also worthy to note that the
          stakeholders involved also play a significant role in determining the
          usefulness of such an IT system. It is clear that policies are crucial
          in the use of facial recognition software because the stakeholders can
          both be held accountable if anything is to occur. In spite of that, as
          aforementioned, we live in a world where everything is developing a
          technological alternative and some technologies might oppose one
          another. What then would we do when making policies for those?

        <h2>A Kind-of Expert Analysis on Expert Systems</h2>
        <p>
          Expert systems are those type of systems; the ones that think they
          know everything. Except they do…well to some extent. You see expert
          systems are programs or software that use human knowledge to mimic the
          expertise of an expert and solve a problem in a specific knowledge
          domain using specific rules.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They have over the years proven to be useful in many areas, such as
          education and training, medical diagnosis, financial decision-making
          and estate and insurance planning. One field that I find the use of
          expert systems particularly striking is in the financial field. In
          this blog post, I am going to evaluate the use of expert systems using
          the INVEX(Investment expert system) as a case study.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          INVEX is a program that helps project analysts decide what projects to
          invest in. It works like any other expert system with a set of
          inference rules, a knowledge base and a user interface. It has an
          interactive user screen that is used to communicate with the user and
          the software asks the user or customer questions about their
          intentions and preferences. This information is used to build up a
          customer profile which would be used in the decision making process.
          The software uses Microsoft Excel for data entry, financial works as
          well as translations. Based on the information in the customer
          profile, the software will divide the investments into five groups
          namely: very bad, bad, medium, good and very good. It does this using
          values of dynamic parameters as seen below:
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://fremariab.github.io/assets/image_invex.png"
          alt="INVEX’s values of dynamic parameters"
          style="height: 100px; width: 30px"
        />
        <br />
        <p>
          Investments from the group very good are accepted, while investments
          from the group very bad are rejected, before it takes part in
          multi-criteria decision-making. For the investments from the groups
          good, medium and bad, a group-specific sensitivity analysis is
          performed and then a user is asked whether to accept or reject each of
          these investments. The first step decreases the number of investments
          that will take part in multi-criteria decision-making, by rejecting
          the bad choices. Total pre-order used in multi-criteria
          decision-making gives the best investments from the set of accepted
          investments.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This financial expert system is useful to both project analysts and
          investors. Project analysts use INVEX to provide guidance to
          businesses on making investment decisions as it is less error-prone
          and time consuming. Investors also use INVEX to help them in deciding
          what investments will give them a greater return.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As much as the INVEX expert system is useful and helps in investment
          management, the use of this software brings about some social or
          ethical concerns. A few of these social or ethical concerns that
          emerge from the use of INVEX are reliability and security.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In some instances, the software is not protected from unauthorized
          access, paving a way for hackers to get access to the information.
          This is risky as when hackers get access to customer profiles they can
          use the information for other purposes which impacts the confidence in
          the system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Moreover, at times the data does not completely correspond with the
          real world. In the financial field, there are often a lot of
          uncertainties. For example, using INVEX helps the managers assess
          future alternatives and the risk levels and return association between
          them. At times uncertain future investments are presented in terms of
          present consumption and resources and some uncertain factors include
          price and demand projections. As a result, reliability issues arise as
          prices may change and this may make the data outdated. It may even
          make the data less accurate since the parameters used to make
          decisions may be outdated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          These issues will impact the aforementioned stakeholders to a large
          extent. For project analysts, if the data is unreliable, the decisions
          that will be made to determine the viability of a project will not be
          good and will affect the business as they will make bad investments.
          This will cause the business to lose a lot of money and make even cost
          the project analyst his job. For the investors, if they invest in the
          investments that the software deems as good but are very bad in
          reality, they will make huge losses. Unreliability will impact the
          investor as well as decrease the value of the investment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To combat these social or ethical concerns, a few solutions can be put
          forward. The knowledge engineer of the expert system can regularly
          review the data or parameters to update them. When they do this the
          data is kept up to date and is more reliable since it has a higher
          correspondence to the real world. Additionally, another way to combat
          the problem, is to introduce ranges for the parameters, prices and
          demand projections. Ranges that include future projections in
          uncertain factors such as price, can make it more reliable. This would
          reduce the likelihood of bad investments being deemed as acceptable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In conclusion, by looking at INVEX, we can see that expert system are
          very useful but only to an extent due to the social and ethical
          concerns associated with it.

        <h2>The Big Fat ‘F’ in Change Management</h2>
        <p>
          How would you feel if you invested millions of dollars into a new
          system only for it to end up faulty? Personally, I wouldn’t be moved
          because, really, what is a million dollars? That’s pocket change…which
          must appear in my pocket right now! Well, more often than not, many
          institutions that undergo change management of IT systems end up in
          project failure, losing millions of dollars in the process. Let me
          explain better.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          In 2013, the Canadian Ministry of Children and Family Development
          spent $182 million (WHEW!) on a new and improved Integrated Case
          Management System to help protect sensitive data, improve service
          delivery and replace 64 different databases. This new system was meant
          to ensure that no vulnerable children were forgotten. Unfortunately,
          after spending all this money, the new system encountered many
          problems like constant breakdowns and some experienced difficulty
          using the system. In this blog post, I am going to evaluate the
          effects of change management of IT systems in an organisation, using
          the aforementioned situation, as a case study.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With such a task of handling thousands (probably millions) of files,
          the new system was supposed to work to the best standard and protect
          all the information that it stored. However it didn’t even launch for
          anyone to make comparisons of standard. It is noticeable that they
          lacked time management. Out of the eight recommendations to be
          evaluated, the group only evaluated six, leaving the other two and
          dubbing the system as incomplete. They did not utilize the time given
          to them from November 29th, 2010 till late 2014. They had 4 good years
          to implement the system and ensure that it would be successful yet it
          failed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Moreover, project failure can be attributed to insufficient resources
          for training and the ignorance of the goals for the system. The
          Canadian Ministry of Children and Family Development had $182 million
          for the whole project yet could not attribute a small portion of the
          money to help train workers and get equipment for training. This
          brings to light another underlying problem which is money management.
          Allocation of money to the different aspects of the project,
          especially training, would have helped the project to be more
          successful as the workers would use it appropriately, reducing the
          time spent and making them more efficient in their work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Canadian Ministry of Children and Family Development started by
          purchasing modern software and partnering with Deloitte Incorporated
          to help them develop and implement the system. They also used modern
          technology and applied privacy principles. For the research roles
          involved in implementing and managing the IT system, the government
          searched for software to use as the backbone of the system and found
          out there were two major software companies namely, Siebel and Curam.
          After research (which I doubt was thorough), the government decided
          that Siebel was the best option. However this software failed them. It
          turns out other countries, that also had new systems to implement,
          used Curam and experienced no challenges.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Considering how they could’ve used their research to alleviate or
          reduce the impact of their problems, they could’ve employed more
          people with expertise, done intense research on the software they used
          as well as focused more on training of workers, and time and money
          management. In my opinion, I believe that nothing was out of their
          control. All of these contributed to the loss of data of vulnerable
          people such as domestic abuse and orphaned children.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All things considered, I hope that I have clearly shown the effects of
          change management of IT systems in organisations with respect to the
          case study. It highlights how a lack of meticulousness and intention
          can have adverse impacts. I urge you today to do everything with a
          consideration of how it may leave a mark on others.

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence : The Truth</h2>
        <p>
          As a child, I encountered many futuristic cartoons such as “My Life as
          A Teenage Robot” and “Robotboy”, which you might be familiar with.
          These shows presented technology as something visionary – something
          the world needed. I grew up to see indeed that in most aspects of the
          world, technology was being introduced. For example, about 4 years
          ago, my dad brought a “Roomba”, an automatic vacuum robot cleaner,
          into the house. Initially, I was excited that I would no longer have
          to spend time sweeping around the house as the Roomba was designed to
          do that, using machine learning. However, at a point in time, I found
          myself asking if I still know how to sweep, if I’ll ever sweep again
          and if Artificial Intelligence will replace humans. This incident
          inspired me to do some research about Artificial Intelligence and the
          myths that surround it. In this blog post, I will not only explore
          some of the myths that are often associated with Artificial
          Intelligence but also present the facts that address these myths.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          Essentially, Artificial Intelligence involves a great deal of machine
          learning, a technique that makes computers produce better results by
          learning from past experiences (Stuart 330). This technique is related
          to the concept of computational intelligence, a concept which
          Artificial Intelligence has its basis. Most people have the
          preconceived notion that technology or Artificial Intelligence
          especially, is going to completely replace humans because it is ever
          evolving and as such will outrule the need for humans in specific
          fields. A great example is in manufacturing where Artificial
          Intelligence is used to accurately predict when a machine needs
          maintenance, also known as predictive maintenance (Kaja Polachowska).
          One may see this to be a great use of technology as it reduces machine
          downtime however others may see it as technology replacing control
          engineers. This myth needs to be flatlined. Artificial Intelligence
          can not replace humans and this is largely based on the fact that
          humans and computers are not the same. You might be thinking “well
          clearly they are different” but let’s look at this on a deeper level.
          Computers have good memory and better mathematical abilities than
          humans which explains why they are used in a number of fields but not
          all fields. This is because in some fields, there is not enough data
          for Artificial Intelligence to work in. Machine learning requires huge
          amounts of data in order to work but in relatively new fields, there
          is little data and thus, Artificial Intelligence can not replace
          humans in that regard.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          However, this brings into question the reliability of Artificial
          Intelligence. The IB refers to reliability as the accuracy of data or
          its correspondence with the real world (International Baccalaureate).
          A significant aspect of Artificial Intelligence relies on the accuracy
          of data as well as it’s correspondence with the real world. If the
          data Artificial Intelligence uses in its machine learning is not
          reliable this has serious implications in many fields. Looking back at
          the example of predictive maintenance, Artificial Intelligence having
          inaccurate data will mean that machine downtime will be increased and
          businesses will be at a loss. To address such a problem, in developing
          Artificial Intelligence, much attention must be paid to the algorithms
          as well as the data. Humans can always involve themselves in data
          mining to ensure that the data that corresponds with the real world is
          always being used. This is another fact that counters the myth that
          Artificial Intelligence completely replaces humans, as it shows that
          Artificial Intelligence creates new jobs and opportunities for humans
          in these fields.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, another myth many believe about Artificial Intelligence
          is that it is objective and unbiased. Many are under the notion that
          Artificial Intelligence lacks subjectivity and is unprejudiced but
          this is not the case. As aforementioned, Artificial Intelligence
          requires a lot of data on a particular topic and at times this data
          may seem to be objective although it is not. For instance, in the
          human resources field, Artificial Intelligence is used to make
          decisions about which candidate is fit for a particular job. In such
          an instance, data about the ideal candidate and how past human
          resource managers made their decisions. However this data ends up
          becoming subjective. This is because the data is not only based on
          scientific evidence but also feelings and personal experiences. This
          ultimately influences the decision made by the Artificial Intelligence
          system and makes the decision bias. I am not so surprised to see that
          such a myth is false because if Artificial Intelligence was made to
          mimic the human brain how can an aspect such as bias be avoided?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Taking all things into consideration, it is clear that many
          preconceived notions about Artificial Intelligence come from the
          social and ethical concern of people and machines where people view
          Artificial Intelligence to be revolutionary, just like I did as a
          child, even to the extent of taking over the world. Artificial
          Intelligence is one of the most significant technological advancements
          I have ever seen. The sooner we debunk these myths, the better,
          because we will start to realize the numerous advantages Artificial
          Intelligence has in store for humans. I read a short story called
          “There Will Come Soft Rains” where a smart house was left standing
          after a war had taken all the humans off the face of the earth. It
          only took a day for the house to fall apart without the humans.
          Evidently, without humans technology would not exist and we need to
          comprehend that at the end of the day, the power rests in our hands.

          Was your drawing a 100% accurate? Would you consider it a good
          representation? These questions come up a lot during the design stage
          of the product development life cycle. The design stage is an
          important stage in the product development life cycle because it
          allows us to be focused, and efficient during the development stage.
          The design stage covers the relationships between the inputs, outputs,
          data structures and processes of the system represented in the form of
          models and design elements. Examples of these models and design
          elements include data flow diagrams, entity relationship diagrams and
          prototypes like wireframes and user interfaces.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the post “The Importance of the Systems Development Life Cycle”, I
          spoke about the Exeat System my ITGS classmates and I tried to
          develop. As we designed our solution, I kept thinking about the
          concerns associated with using these computer models to achieve an
          accurate representation of the Exeat System. In this blog post, I will
          be sharing some challenges designers face when creating a computer
          model of some aspect of the world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          One challenge designers face when creating a computer model of some
          aspect of the world is the complexity of the real world. There are an
          infinite amount of possibilities in the world but it is hard to model
          that using technology. One way to overcome this is to make assumptions
          about the unknown possibilities. However, making assumptions can null
          the reliability of the model since it is not 100% accurate.
        </p>
        <br />

          Moreover, another challenge faced by designers creating a computer
          model is the possibility that they may not have an understanding of
          how the real life system works to create a model. A typical example is
          the prediction of the occurrence of earthquakes. In reality, it is
          difficult to predict these and as a result, it will be difficult for a
          designer to create a model representing some aspect of the world.

          Additionally, another challenge designers will face is the creation of
          a computer model relying heavily on research and past events.
          Designers will create a computer model that works effectively based on
          past and current information. The model will not be able to work
          effectively in the future as conditions may have changed. This reduces
          the effectiveness of the model and it will also not be a good
          representation of the real world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All things considered, these are challenges that make the work of
          designers difficult as they create computer models of some aspect of
          the world. These challenges may be hard to overcome and may make the
          computer model slightly inaccurate, however, they are also proof that
          computer models can never accurately and perfectly represent the real
          world. Just like your drawing and the flower, there is always going to
          be that difference between the model and the real world. It’s only as
          real as it gets…
